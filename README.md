# Copier
Renames and moves input files into a target directory

Designed for quickly gathering a lot of files into a directory that may have conflicting names or be out of order.
In effect, once a target directory is chosen an 'input' folder will open in file explorer, any files dropped in there will be renamed to match the clipboard and moved to the target directory.
If there's already a file with the same name, the name is incremented by 1 (possibly including appending a number, or just increasing what number is present)
